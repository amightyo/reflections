When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I intend to collaborate with others. Having other contributors on the work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    In order to avoid introducing any bug made by contributors to the local master branch.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones of repo on GitHub, Clones are copies of the repo on a local directory, 
    Branches are the levels of commit made on local repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The benefit is that you risk pulling a new commit from the remote after the last known state.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I sometimes use GoogleDoc or Dropbox. For collaborative research writing, I use WriteLaTeX 
    which is now called Overleaf. Git/GitHub makes it easier to checkout various commits at any time. 
    Conflicts are reduced and productivity is optimized using Git/GitHub.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When I intend to perform some further testing or introduce a new idea which I want my collaborators 
    to examine via pull requests before merging to master branch. It affords one to keep the original 
    master branch intact until a final decision is made.
